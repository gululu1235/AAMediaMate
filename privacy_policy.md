AAMediaMate App Privacy Policy

Last updated: [Month Day, Year]

AAMediaMate (“the App”) respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle user data:

Data Access

The App requests Notification Listener permission to read media playback information (song title, artist, album art) from other media apps.

This data is used only for showing currently playing media and synchronized lyrics in the App and in Android Auto.

Data Collection

The App does not collect, store, or share your personal data or playback history.

All media information stays locally on your device.

Third-Party Services

If you enable the Lyrics feature, the App may request lyrics from third-party APIs such as Musixmatch (via RapidAPI) or a user-provided API endpoint.

These requests contain only the song title and artist name.

The App does not control third-party services’ data use. Please refer to their privacy policies.

Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13.

No personal information is knowingly collected.

Changes

This policy may be updated. Any changes will be reflected here.
